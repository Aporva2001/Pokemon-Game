# 🎮 Text-Based Pokémon Game in C++

Welcome to a text-based Pokémon game built using the C++ programming language! This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in an engaging, interactive way.

## 🧠 Features

- 📦 **Object-Oriented Design:** Built using principles of OOP — encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- 🧾 **Multiple Pokémon Classes:** Each Pokémon has unique stats, types, and abilities implemented via class hierarchies.
- ⚔️ **Battle System:** Turn-based battle mechanics including HP, attack, defense, and special abilities.
- 🗺️ **Game Flow:** Interactive CLI-based gameplay with options like battle, heal, view Pokémon, and more.
- 🧪 **Random Events:** Wild Pokémon appearances and attack outcomes use basic random number generation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Compiler:** g++, clang++, etc.
- **Platform:** Terminal / Command Line Interface
